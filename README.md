This repository contains the standard library for the [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko) programming language. 

The original standard library (known as "base") is available [here](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base).

## Quick Start

A preview of the core library is available via the [`core`](https://mops.one/core) Mops package.

You can quickly try out the core library by making the following change to your `mops.toml` config file:

```toml
core = "0.5.0"
```

It's also possible to use the latest changes in the GitHub repository:

```toml
core = "https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core"
```

Since this is a preview release for community feedback, expect breaking changes.
Please report any bugs or inconsistencies by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core/issues). 

## Local Environment

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 22.x` and the latest version of [`dfx`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install) are installed on your system.

Run the following commands to configure your local development branch:

```sh
# First-time setup
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core
cd motoko-core
npm ci
npx ic-mops toolchain init
```

Below is a quick reference for commonly-used scripts during development:

```sh
npm test # Run all tests
npm run format # Format Motoko files
npm run validate:api # Update the public API lockfile
npm run validate:docs Array # Run code snippets in `src/Array.mo`
```

All available scripts can be found in the project's [`package.json`](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core/blob/main/package.json) file.
